# PolymerCodelabs for Version 1.0

Resources of [Polymer Codelabs](http://itshackademic.com/static/codelabs/en/1-polymer-first-app/) is currently only for Polymer 0.5. Unfortunately Polymer 0.5 is absolutely different from Polymer 1.0 (See. [Migration Guide](https://www.polymer-project.org/1.0/docs/migration.html).) I made some of the resources fit for 1.0.
